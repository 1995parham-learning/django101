# Let's Learn Django

## Introduction

I've started to work with Django when I first encountered with World Wide Web (WWW) for writing a web application for Sharif Energy Water Nexus Event, which is available [here](https://github.com/Panamo/EnerWat).
Since then, I use Go more than Python, so I need to refresh my memory and also celebrate my great memories with [Mohammad Mahboubi](https://github.com/mrma95) and [Navid Mashayekhi](https://github.com/navidmsk).
